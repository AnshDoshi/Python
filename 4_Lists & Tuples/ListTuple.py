# A tuple is an immutable (can’t change or modified) data type in Python.

# a = ()              #It is an example of empty tuple

a = (1,)           #Tuple with only one element needs a comma

# a = (1, 7, 2)   #Tuple with more than one element
# Once defined, tuple elements can’t be manipulated or altered.
print(a)
